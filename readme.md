This is just a quick and dirty prototype that creates slow motion lightning strikes.
As this is just a quick 4h project, there was no real focus on code quality. Sorry about that ðŸ˜…

The app uses the [Zircon tile engine](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon) and starts a Swing application that just generates and renders lightning strikes like these:
